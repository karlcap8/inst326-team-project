# Research Data Pipeline - Function Library

## Project Overview

This function library provides the foundational utilities for a research data pipeline designed to process and clean survey data collected through platforms such as Qualtrics. The library includes functions for data ingestion, de-identification, cleaning, validation, and documentation. These functions will form the groundwork for future object-oriented modules that automate the research data lifecycle â€” from raw input to structured, analysis-ready datasets.

## Problem Statement

Researchers frequently face challenges when working with raw survey data, such as:
-Confusing column headers and inconsistent file structures from survey platforms
-Presence of personally identifiable information (PII) requiring removal or anonymization
-Mixed data types, missing values, and inconsistent formatting
-Lack of validation for input ranges or categorical responses
-Absence of standardized codebooks documenting dataset variables and structures
Our function library addresses these issues by creating a consistent, automated process to clean and prepare research data for analysis, ensuring data integrity, security, and reproducibility.
